The Garuda Purana is a significant Hindu text that deals with specific issues of Hindu philosophy connected with death, funeral rites, and reincarnation. It is one of the eighteen Puranas and is a part of the Vaishnavism literature corpus, primarily centering around Hindu god Vishnu. The text is essentially a dialogue between Lord Vishnu and Garuda, a kind of bird.

The Garuda Purana is divided into two parts: the Purvakhanda (early section) and the Uttarakhanda (later section, also known as Pretakhanda or Pretakalpa). The Purvakhanda contains about 229 chapters, while the Uttarakhanda varies between 34 and 49 chapters. The text discusses various aspects of life, death, and the afterlife, providing insights into the Hindu understanding of these concepts.

One of the key themes in the Garuda Purana is the journey of the soul at the point of death and after death. According to the text, the soul's passage is marked by physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pain, particularly due to detachment and attachment to human life. The text suggests that the soul is usually visited by a form of God that the individual understands best, often their own guru, who guides them through the next phase of their journey.

The Garuda Purana also describes the consequences of good and bad deeds in one's lifetime. It mentions 28 deadly punishments for various sins, providing a detailed account of the suffering that awaits those who have not lived a virtuous life. On the other hand, those who have done good deeds are said to attain heaven after death.

The Garuda Purana is considered an essential text for followers of Hinduism, providing posthumous knowledge and addressing questions related to death, human movement after death, Yoni, Shraddha, and the means to alleviate the sorrows of hell. The text has been preserved in various manuscripts, with about 8,000 verses surviving into the modern era. The Garuda Purana is available in various languages, including Hindi, and can be accessed through applications and books.
