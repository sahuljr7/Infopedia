The northeastern states of India are:

1. Arunachal Pradesh
2. Assam
3. Manipur
4. Meghalaya
5. Mizoram
6. Nagaland
7. Tripura

These seven states, collectively known as the "Seven Sisters", are located in the northeastern region of the country. They share international borders with several neighboring countries like Bhutan, China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh, and are connected to the rest of India by a narrow land corridor called the Siliguri Corridor or Chicken's Neck.

The northeastern states are known for their diverse ethnic communities, rich cultural heritage, and beautiful landscapes. However, the region has also faced developmental challenges due to its geographic isolation and internal conflicts.
