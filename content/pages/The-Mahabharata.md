The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. It is considered one of the longest epic poems ever written, containing over 200,000 verses. The Mahabharata is attributed to the sage Vyasa and is believed to have been composed between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE.

At its core, the Mahabharata is a complex narrative that revolves around the conflict between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, for the throne of Hastinapura. The Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, are portrayed as virtuous and righteous, while the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, are depicted as more ambitious and power-hungry.

The epic explores various themes such as dharma (duty/righteousness), karma (action and its consequences), and the nature of existence. It contains numerous subplots, including philosophical discourses, moral dilemmas, and tales of love and betrayal. One of the most famous sections of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between the warrior Arjuna and the god Krishna, which addresses important philosophical and ethical questions.

The Mahabharata has had a profound influence on Indian culture and has been retold and adapted in various forms over the centuries, including literature, art, theater, and television. It continues to be a source of inspiration and contemplation for people around the world.
